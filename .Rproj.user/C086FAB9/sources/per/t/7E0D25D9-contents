## Load Data

The first step is to load the data

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Reproducible_Assignment1")
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## Initial Analysis

What is the total number of steps taken per day?

For this analysis, the missing values in the data set have been ignored. First we will show a histogram of the complete dataset.

```{r}
hist(activity_data$steps[activity_data$steps > 0], main = "Histogram of Steps Taken Daily", xlab = "Steps")

newdata <- na.omit(activity_data)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = newdata,
       aes(x = newdata$steps )) +
         geom_histogram(binwidth = 25)
```

     Next we calculate the mean and median values of the dataset 

```{r}
mean(activity_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median(activity_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
## Pattern of Daily Activity

What is the daily activity pattern?

```{r warning = FALSE}
DailyPat <- aggregate(x=activity_data, by=list(activity_data$interval),                      FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)


plot(DailyPat$interval, DailyPat$steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Steps")
```

How many rows contain NA?

```{r}
summary(activity_data)
```
## Dealing with Missing Values

We can use the mice library to impute missing values
```{r}
library("mice")
imp <- mice(activity_data, m=1)
activity_data2 <- complete(imp)
```
Draw histgram and calculate mean and median
```{r}
hist(activity_data2$steps)
mean(activity_data2$steps)
median(activity_data2$steps)
```

Now we will see if the activity takes place on a weekday or weekend by creating a new factor variable.
```{r ECHO = FALSE}
library(plyr)
dayofweek <- weekdays(as.Date(activity_data2$date))
activity_data_weekdays <- cbind(activity_data2, dayofweek)
activity_data_weekdays$dayofweek <- ifelse(activity_data_weekdays$dayofweek %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")

```
Next we plot and look at the differences

```{r}
ggplot(data = activity_data_weekdays, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
         geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~dayofweek)

```
